# Agent

This project is based primarily on the tutorial from [ampcode.com: How to Build an Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent).

## Overview

## Main Features

- Tool definitions for reading files and listing files in the working directory
- JSON schema-based input validation for tools
